This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a *mahima* will be **wants pizza** that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r }
1+1

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
